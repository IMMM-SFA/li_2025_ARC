# metarepo
## [Check out the website for instructions](https://immm-sfa.github.io/metarepo)
`metarepo` is short for meta-repository, a GitHub repository that contains instructions to reproduce results in a published work. This repo is a template for creating your own metarepo.

## Purpose
A meta-repository creates a single point of access for someone to find all of the components that were used to create a published work for the purpose of reproducibility. This repository should contain references to all minted data and software as well as any ancillary code used to transform the source data, create figures for your publication, conduct the experiment, and / or execute the contributing software.

## Abstract
White roof is a widely-studied urban heat mitigation strategy and frequently incorporated into climate adaptation plans by cities.
Assessing the effects of white roofs on temperature has often been approached from the perspective of applied meteorology.
Here, the white roof problem is reframed to a climate science problem by focusing on the roof surface temperature, incorporating concepts of climate forcing, sensitivity, and feedback, and utilizing a linearized surface energy balance (SEB) model.
Different from the Albedo Cooling Effectiveness (ACE) index used for \textit{quantifying} white roof effects, a new index called Albedo Cooling Sensitivity ($\mathrm{ACS_s}$, where the subscript s indicates surface) is proposed as a stepping stone towards
\textit{understanding} white roof effects. The variability of $\mathrm{ACS_s}$ simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is found to be strongly related to the variability of convective heat transfer efficiency.
It is recommended that climate forcing, sensitivity, and feedback should be integrated into studying a wide range of urban adaptation strategies.


## Journal reference
_your journal reference_

## Code reference
References for each minted software release for all code involved.

These are generated by Zenodo automatically when conducting a release when Zenodo has been linked to your GitHub repository. The Zenodo references are built by setting the author order in order of contribution to the code using the author's GitHub username.  This citation can, and likely should, be edited without altering the DOI.

If you have modified a codebase that is outside of a formal release, and the modifications are not planned on being merged back into a version, fork the parent repository and add a `.<shortname>` to the version number of the parent and construct your own name.  For example, `v1.2.5.hydro`.

Fill in detailed info here or link to other documentation to thoroughly walkthrough how to use the contents of this repository to reproduce your experiment. Below is an example.


1. Install the software components required to conduct the experiment from [contributing modeling software](#contributing-modeling-software)
2. Download and install the supporting [input data](#input-data) required to conduct the experiment
3. Run the following scripts in the `workflow` directory to re-create this experiment:

| Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `step_one.py` | Script to run the first part of my experiment | `python3 step_one.py -f /path/to/inputdata/file_one.csv` |
| `step_two.py` | Script to run the second part of my experiment | `python3 step_two.py -o /path/to/my/outputdir` |

4. Download and unzip the [output data](#output-data) from my experiment
5. Run the following scripts in the `workflow` directory to compare my outputs to those from the publication

| Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compare.py` | Script to compare my outputs to the original | `python3 compare.py --orig /path/to/original/data.csv --new /path/to/new/data.csv` |

## Reproduce my figures
Use the scripts found in the `figures` directory to reproduce the figures used in this publication.

| Figure Number(s) | Script Name | Description | How to Run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1, 2 | `generate_plot.py` | Description of figure, ie. "Plots the difference between our two scenarios" | `python3 generate_plot.py -input /path/to/inputs -output /path/to/outuptdir` |
| 3 | `generate_figure.py` | Description of figure, ie. "Shows how the mean and peak differences are calculated" | `python3 generate_figure.py -input /path/to/inputs -output /path/to/outuptdir` |
